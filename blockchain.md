<span>U</span><strong>nless you’re hiding under the rock,</strong> I am sure you’d have heard of Bitcoins and Blockchain. After all, they are the trending and media’s favorite topics these days — the buzzwords of the year. Even the people who’ve never mined a cryptocurrency or understand how it works, are talking about it. I have more non-technical friends than technical ones. They have been bugging me for weeks to explain this new buzzword to them. I guess there are thousands out there who feel the same. And when that happens, there comes a time to write something to which everyone can point the other lost souls to — that’s the purpose of this post — written in plain english that any regular internet user understands.

Everyone says the blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, is going to change EVERYTHING. And yet, after years of tireless effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use for the blockchain—besides currency speculation and illegal transactions.

Token Curated Registries (TCRs) are a building block of decentralized applications based on fungible tokens (FTs) and digital scarcity. They are fast becoming one of the hottest “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/towards-a-hierarchy-of-token-building-blocks-6c8dd7b42341" target="_blank">Token Building Blocks</a>” for decentralized <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain" target="_blank">blockchain</a> applications. The use cases for TCRs are far reaching, everything from a simple whitelist to full blown decentralized governance. In this post I discuss some <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/design" target="_blank">design</a> patterns for TCRs and potential use cases. I am not purporting to know the Schelling point parameters, nor have I built these TCRs. This is for design thinking and use case exploration to spur innovation in the community.
